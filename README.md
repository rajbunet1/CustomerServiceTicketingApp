# CustomerServiceTicketingApp
# Software Engineering and Agile

This web app is for customer service representatives to create customer service tickets for a mobile company but also allowing customers to directly create tickets of issues on the site where customer service agents can then pick them up. They can register as customers, create, and view their tickets, which can be later responded by a person that works at the company, either an admin or a regular worker. Each ticket has important information that helps the workers to successfully process them without forming a mess and losing them, they get ordered by the current status and the date each ticket was created, this way they get prioritized implicitly so no ticket gets lost without being responded.
